# Guessing Game with Decision Tree
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/r9DFAUL56qg>
#### Description:
The Guessing Game with Decision Tree is a Python-based interactive game that attempts to guess what the user is thinking by asking a series of yes/no questions. The game is built around a binary decision tree, where each node represents a question, and the responses guide the user down different branches of the tree until a final answer is reached.

The program starts by prompting the user to think of an object, such as an animal or a technological device, and then systematically asks questions to narrow down the possibilities. Depending on the userâ€™s answers, the game traverses the decision tree until it arrives at a final guess. If the guessed answer is correct, the game ends; otherwise, the user can restart and play again.

The game structure is entirely text-based, making it easy to play in a command-line interface. It features recursive question handling, input validation for yes/no responses, and a replay option that allows users to go through multiple rounds. The decision tree is currently hardcoded with a limited set of questions, but it can be easily extended to include more categories and objects.

This project demonstrates key programming concepts, including recursion, data structures (binary trees), and user input handling in Python. It is a simple yet effective implementation of decision trees, which are widely used in artificial intelligence and machine learning for classification tasks
